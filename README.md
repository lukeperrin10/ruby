The syntax error tells me that on line 2 of the program there the line was closed with a bracket ')' instead of a brace '}' causing the program to stop.

The second program does not run as the variable 'x' is undefined outside of the method, moving the x inside the program lets the program run. 

array 1. becomes [["b", 1], ["b", 2], ["b", 3], ["a", 1], ["a", 2], ["a", 3]] 

array 2. becomes [1, 2, 3]

to return "example" use arr[1][0]

arr 1. arr.index(5) tells you that the number 5 is in postion 3 in the array

arr 2. creates a NoMethodError

arr 3. 8

a = "e"
b = "A"
c = nil

using in [] with a string inside does not work, changing it to names [3] = 'Judy' changes the postition. i.e Margaret becoming Judy.

puts "#{person[:name]}

x on first hash x: is a key and does not take on the variable string, unlike in second hash where x takes on variable value "hi there"
